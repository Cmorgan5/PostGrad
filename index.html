    <h2>About Us: </h2>
    <p>Post-Grad, an web application designed to be a great tool of use to assist graduates all over the world with trying to break that difficult barrier of getting a job in their career field. </p>


    <br>
   <h2> Motivation </h2>
   <p> We were motivated to a create a web application that would better assist recent or upcoming graduates with the aspects of job-hunting.  Anything to make the process of finding a job in today’s market much easier is a big driving force for all participants involved in this project. This a project, if done right can possibly have a profound effect in assisting graduates that are looking for some type of way to gain exposure and possibly communicate with companies looking to hire. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Architecture </h2>

  <p>The “Post-Grad” web app is going to be multi-user software that will connect users through the schools in which they graduated and by the jobs they currently posses. Scalability is a concern with multi-user scenarios, but having multiple thousand users  would be unexpected. The login system will have password encryption for user protection, along with system locking after “X” failed attempts. The web application could possibly be hosted on Hostgator or on siteground. Using PHPmyadmin, along with PDO sql connection to the Database, this will increase security for the users and help prevent SQL injection. The website will follow a MVC to help with maintaining fast speed and maintainable software for future updates if necessary.
